# 📒 NoteApp

An Android application for managing notes with support for search, pinning, and detail editing.  
Built using **Clean Architecture**, **MVVM**, **Jetpack Compose**, and **Hilt** to ensure scalability, maintainability, and testability.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Create, update, and delete notes  
- Pin/unpin notes (only one note pinned at a time)  
- Real-time search across titles and descriptions  
- Grid/List layout toggle
- Persistent storage using Room  
- Reactive state with Kotlin Flows  
- Unit tests and UI tests

---

## 🏛️ Architecture

The app follows **Clean Architecture** with layered separation of concerns and **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** at the presentation layer.
